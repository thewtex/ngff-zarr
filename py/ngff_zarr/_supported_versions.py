#: The OME-Zarr 0.9 development series, oldest first. Each tag extends the one
#: before: dev1 is 0.6 plus RFC-3 and RFC-4, dev3 is dev1 plus RFC-8. A tuple
#: rather than a frozenset: membership tests compare with ``==``, so a
#: non-string ``version`` object cannot raise on hashing.
V09_DEV_SERIES = (NgffVersion.V09dev1, NgffVersion.V09dev3)

#: The ``ome.version`` string written to disk for the API version ``"0.6"``.
#: The 0.6 spec is a release candidate, so a store is tagged with the
#: pre-release the bundled ``spec/0.6`` schemas carry rather than with the bare
#: ``"0.6"`` the public ``version`` option accepts. Mirrors the TypeScript
#: port's ``V06_ONDISK_VERSION``; this constant is the one place the tag lives.
V06_ONDISK_VERSION = NgffVersion.V06rc0

#: 0.6 pre-release tags that earlier ngff-zarr releases wrote and that the
#: bundled schemas no longer accept. A store carrying one differs from a valid
#: store in that string alone; the validating reader says so and checks the
#: rest, and ``upgrade_ome_zarr`` rewrites the tag. Any other tag is checked
#: as given, so a tag from a later spec release is not passed off as this one.

def is_v06_version(version: object | None) -> bool:
    """Whether ``version`` identifies OME-Zarr v0.6, dev releases included.

    Mirrors the TypeScript port's ``isV06Version`` so a store written by
    either implementation is recognized the same way. Anything that is not a
    string -- ``None`` included -- is not v0.6.

    Tested with ``isinstance`` rather than ``str()``: a :class:`NgffVersion`
    member is a ``str`` subclass under both the stdlib ``StrEnum`` (3.11+) and
    the backport above, but only the former renders as its value under
    ``str()``; the backport renders as ``"NgffVersion.V06dev4"``.
